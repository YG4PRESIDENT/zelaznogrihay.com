I believe there's a certain beauty in simplicity. In a web that's constantly screaming for attention, a quiet corner can be a refuge.

This site is an experiment in that belief. It's built with minimal tools, designed to be easy to maintain, and focused purely on the content. No trackers, no pop-ups, no complex frameworks. Just words and pictures.

It's a place for my thoughts to breathe.
