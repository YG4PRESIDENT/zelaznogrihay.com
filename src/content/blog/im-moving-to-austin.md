Its official, I am moving to Austin Texas. I've been throwing around the concept for over a year trying to convince myself of making it a reality. But when it came down to the figuring out the irl logistics, the vision became that much more real. My plan was to move there with my best friend Cam and do the Shaan Puri strat ([https://www.shaanpuri.com/mailbag/strategically-broke](https://www.shaanpuri.com/mailbag/strategically-broke) ) but this isn't going to be the case, at least not initially. 

I am Disheartened by this deviation to the original plan, but this will not waver my commitment. I am moving to chase my dreams and that is final.

Its fucking real now. I have a personal training job lined up so that i can pay the bills; ive been calling it getting the minecraft stone tools and getting food/wood part of the plan. I have a great 1 bed 1 bath apartment that I got with the help of my beautiful mom, this is the launch pad with a great location. And most importantly i have this palpably ambitious mind that is going to do what ever it takes.  I will literally drown and tear everything if thats what it takes

This move is a clean slate. It feels like a soft death in many ways. What i am and what i have become in Oregon is all the past. This is the next chapter of my lore. I am leaving my family, my friends, I am taking a gamble on myself. A true honest bet that I can make it and endure the suffering. It feels like im about to enter this massive wave where i will likely crash, but I will never feel the glory and taste that feeling of flow unless we do it and give it your God honest effect to ride the wave.

I am ready to die and be reborn (metaphorically).  I can see the vision that I want for my life. Pursuing work that I find compelling, exploring the wrld with ultimate play with my future wife, having a blast with my kids, enjoying meals with my parents, playing poker in the beautiful game room at the crib with my brother. Hosting my friends for dinners. 

If you can see it, and you have the courage to speak it, then it will happen. Shout out OG McGregor 

My life is ?\!   There are so many unknowns it almost feels like the entire plot is unknown, there are scenarios that are more likely to happen than others but nothing is known ? I am embracing these questions to the fullest extent and am excited for how it will all unfold.

I have trust in myself and in the universe that the dots will connect \!

Cheers to an adventure
