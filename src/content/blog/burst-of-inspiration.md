I know I am great. I know I am elite. I will make it. I will give everything I have, my entire soul. I will smash my face into the wall and go again. Failure is death. Nothing matters except relentlessly going after it until things start to happen.  Imaginary walls exists every, they dont matter. I am prolific. I am abundant. Life is a miracle, and I have the tools to capture it fully. I am a pillar for those who can't, for those who couldn't. Wavering isn't in my blood. I carry the weight of the forgotten, the shadowed, the children dealt a losing hand, the people trapped in their small corners of possibility, those in the local maxima. I am proof. I am a beam that strikes the wrld with glory.  Make your existence matter. You get one shot at this, but remember that this is infinite.
